# Inspector

An extension to inspect details of elements.

## Installation

* Add the following to `config.json`:
```json
"_inspector": {
	"_isEnabled": true,
	"_disableOnTouch": true,
	"_tracUrl": "",
	"tracSummaryPrompt": ""
}
```
* Optionally, populate `_tracUrl` to make Inspector link to a specific [Trac](https://trac.edgewall.org) and, if required, add a summary prompt to `tracSummaryPrompt` - if you don't prompt the user to enter a summary you might find you end up with a long list of component/page ids in your Trac ticket report - which isn't that helpful!
* With [Adapt CLI](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-cli) installed, run `adapt install inspector`. Alternatively, download the ZIP and extract into the src > extensions directory.
* Run an appropriate Grunt task.

## Usage

* Elements are annotated on visit with their types and IDs.
* Select the element IDs to create tickets on Trac.
* Hover over the IDs for tooltips containing additional details.
